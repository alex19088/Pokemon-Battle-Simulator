To run the game, first make sure the correct IPv4 Address is set in the constructor (currently set to local host).

Next, run the "server.py" file. Then run the "clientGUI.py" file. The clientGUI file is the client that will constantly accept and send messages to the server. 

Finally, enter your name so that the server can store your information as an object.

The game can only start when 3 clients establish a connection with the server!
